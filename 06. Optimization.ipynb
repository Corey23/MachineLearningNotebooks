    "Essentially, we want to update the Hessian with an approximation that is easily invertible and based on stable gradient calculations. We can define the approximate Hessian for each iteration, $\\mathbf{H}_k$. To start as simple as possible, we will assume the Hessian can be approximated with one vector. Let's start off with a few other assumptions. We wil develop some equations that characterize a family of solutions. Within this family, we will only give one popular example for the rank one family solution and one popular example for the rank two family solution. \n",

If we enforce this relationship, we can find the hessian, assuming that the current location is approximated well by a quadratic (making the Secant a good assumption also). We also want the Hessian to be symmetric and not too far away from its initial value (for stable optimization).\n",

    "For optimizing, we would like to be able to update the Hessian at $\\mathbf{w}_{k+1}$ from our previous guess, $\\mathbf{H}_k$ at $\\mathbf{w}_{k}$, and have the update be easy to calculate. Therefore, we can choose the update of the Hessian to be approximated by the rank one update (one vector). Since the Hessian is the second partial derivative, a starting approximation might be the gradient difference we already defined such that  $\\mathbf{H} \\approx \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}^T$ which would form a matrix of the differences of each partial deriviative in the gradient. In practice, we need a vector that is slightly less constrained, such that    \n",

    "\n",
    "**Now for the power of this method.** We can now assume that the inverse of the Hessian can be optimized and formulate similar equations for its update, based upon the previous inverse.
